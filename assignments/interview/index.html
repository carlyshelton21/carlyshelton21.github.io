It looks very old school and classic. It feels comfortable to the point that one wants to purchase it just like purchasing a cup of coffee at starbucks.</h4>

                        <h1>Q:</h1>
                            <h2>What do you know about Marlboro’s branding choices? Specifically, if there was a specific identity for the cigarettes themselves?</h2>
                      </div>
                          <div class="column2" style="background-color:#e33838;">
                              <h1>A:</h1>
                                <p>After Coca Cola, Marlboro became the second most expensive brand in the world back in the day. The identity of the cigarettes relates a lot to the Marlboro man who is not as present in the cigarettes as he used to be before. The Marlboro man was this middle aged, mature looking cowboy.
                                    He was an attractive man which gave Marlboro cigarettes that classy look and identity. </p>
                          </div>
                      <div class="column2" style="background-color:#f66767;">
                        <h1>Q:</h1>
                            <h2>I know Marlboro started advertising their cigarettes towards women and then changed to a more masculine branding approach in the 1950’s, when you worked there did you sense there was a strong point in the branding department to advertise to men?</h2>
                      </div>
                          <div class="column2" style="background-color:#e33838;">
                            <h1>A:</h1>
                                <p>So before the 50’s the Marlboro man was intended to make woman attracted to him and that is why cigarette branding was more towards women but it turned out that men identified with the man more or wanted to be like him to eventually it ended up targeting more men than women. I started working at the factory as a director in 1968 and the publicity did not really change anymore. </p>

                            <h1>Q:</h1>
                                <h2>I know that the branding at Marlboro has not changed much since the 1950’s, but when you worked there, were there any changes to the branding and advertising of the brand?</h2>
                          </div>
                              <div class="column3" style="background-color:#e33838;">
                                  <h1>A:</h1>
                                    <p>The changes began because of health issues. Cigarettes did not have filters before and we had to start adding filters because of health laws the government was passing. The impact of the cigarettes also changed like how harsh they would be and the different cigarettes started being made such as light or menthols etc. </p>

                            <h1>Q:</h1>
                                <h2>Do you believe that cigarette branding is more effective than the actual blend of the tobacco itself?</h2>
                          </div>
                              <div class="column3" style="background-color:#e33838;">
                                <h1>A:</h1>
                                    <p>Absolutely, there have been cigarettes made with amazing tobacco blends but the advertising or branding was not great so they never became popular. The branding is a key factor for success in any product not only in cigarettes.</p>
